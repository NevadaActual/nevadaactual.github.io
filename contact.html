				<p>While these two very similar games took the same core concept from Asteroids as a base, they both have very different executions.</p>
				<h1 id="leftheading" class="compare">The Audio</h1>
				<div id="flexleft" class="compare">
					<div>
						<p>For Nova Drift, sound effects are a core part of the gameplay. Guns sound punchy, impacts are powerful, and most importantly the soundtrack is high energy. You can't really catch a break when playing on higher difficulties, and the music plays right into that.</p>

						<p>On the other hand, BYTEPATH is far more subtle in its sound. Your weapons are barely audible, explosions are characterized by the deafening silence and slow-motion effect caused in their wake, and the music tops it all off with a chill, synthwave vibe. The tone of the music matchs well with the old-school terminal of an UI, and doesn't have high-energy tempos.

				<div id="flexright" class="compare">
					<div>
						<p>For Nova Drift, players only gain temporary power per run. When they lose, they start from Wave 1 with no gear or mods. Their decisions on what upgrades to take and not take, as well as other optional gamemodes allowing you to banish mods entirely instead of rerolling, give the player complete control over what they do and don't want to play. If they make poor decisions though, their run will be affected negatively, incentivizing tactical decisions.</p>
						<p>BYTEPATH on the other hand, has players making long-term decisions. They can undo their allocation of SP, but with no refunds taking place players are incentivized to make the best of rash decisions. If they can't seem to make something work, they'll try something else, but since all the upgrades are difficult to afford exploration of builds is a slower process. The slow snowball of bonuses from passive, classes, and devices however makes it near impossible for a player to make the game harder on themselves, or impossible to beat.</p>

				<h1 id="leftheading" class="compare">The Graphics</h1>
				<div id="flexleft" class="compare">
					<div>
						<p>Nova Drift is the work of a team of devs, over several years. It's still being developed today, and the style and graphics are polished to match. Everything feel smooth, from guns to enemies to bosses to UI. There's very little to complain about, especially since any major issues are addressed very quickly if reported on the developers Discord server.</p>
						<p>BYTEPATH, on the other hand, was made in 6 months by a single dev. He never expected the project to take off like it did, and made the entire game open source on github after release. The graphics are very simple, being made dynamically in-engine using basic polygons and lots of math. There's some polish added using chromatic abberation to add the illusion of movement on top of said polygons, but that's about it. This doesn't detract from the game's aesthetic however, since the entire game runs in a "terminal".</p>

				<h1 id="center" class="compare">What's the Point?</h1>
				<p>Both of these games have very similar base gameplay. You have a ship with a gun, and you need to shoot the things coming from off-screen to progress. But the sheer distance between how the two games play shows just how much difference a creative vision can make for such a simple concept. It's not really fair to compare the two games in the sense of "which is better", when one has been a massive project for years now and the other was a 6 month throwaway project, acting as a tutorial for prospective game devs looking for inspiration. Nonetheless, both of these games are unique in both aethetics, gameplay, and feel, in a way I felt was interesting enough to make a website about it. I hope this was as entertaining to read as it was for me to write it. :)</p>
