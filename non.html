				<p>BYTEPATH is a game, similar to Nova Drift, based on the gameplay of the original Asteroids. The classic arcade formula of off-screen obstacles hurtling towards your ship is a cultural touchstone for many, but BYTEPATH adds some spice to that formula in an unique way.</p>

						<h2>The Passive Tree</h2>
						<p>The main difference between this game and any other Asteroids-like is the passive tree. While you play the game, you collect small orange tokens called "SP" (assumedly "skill points"). Opening the passive tree is initially overwhelming, but after looking around you will eventually realize there is some interesting abilities locked away at a fair distance: removing all of your health to instead have a recharging energy shield, making you have infinite ammo but changing your weapon randomly every 5 seconds, etc.<p>

						<h2>Classes and Devices</h2>
						<p>The other major change is the addition of Classes and Devices. Classes are a set of small bonuses that change the game drastically, while Devices change base stats, letting all of your passives and Classes scale better (or worse, depending on what your goal is). Both of these are only obtainable through SP, so trying to properly manage that resource becomes a puzzle where you try to figure out where you can get the most benefit with the least amount spent.</p>

						<h2>What's the Point?</h2>
						<p>The goal of this game is to collect 8 mysterious keys that appear the more difficult the game becomes. You can't just throw yourself at the enemies and hope for the best, but have to instead gain enough power and synergy in your set-up to make the distance and collect all of the keys. Once you do however, the game resets, removing your progress entirely except for a small permanent buff to the maximum number of passive skills you can have at once. So while the game can be "beat", many players will be happy to try to go the distance once again, but with new knowledge and trying different passives and classes.</p>
