Hello!

This is just the files for the website, I couldn't figure out how to both upload a URL and a zip file so I decided to link you here. If you want the zip of everything, here it is: https://github.com/NevadaActual/nevadaactual.github.io/archive/refs/heads/main.zip.

For the website itself, visit https://nevadaactual.github.io/index.html.
