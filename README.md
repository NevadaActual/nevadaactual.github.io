Hello!

This is just the files for the website, I couldn't figure out how to both upload a URL and a zip file so I decided to link you here. If you want the zip of everything, click the green "code" button in the top right, and then click "download Zip".

For the website itself, visit " https://nevadaactual.github.io/index.html ".
