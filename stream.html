				<p>Nova Drift is game that is, like BYTEPATH, modeled after the original Asteroids, where players have to shoot down any obstacle that comes from offscreen. A well-trodden concept, but the real source of player agency and enjoyment comes from the sheer diversity of choices the player gets to make.</p>

						<h2>The Upgrade Menu</h2>
						<p>Every time you kill enough enemies, you level up and gain an upgrade point. When you open your upgrade menu, you get a random set of modifications to choose from. If you've previously upgraded a tier 1 mod, the respective tier 2 mods from that tree will be available. You want bigger guns? You'll find more upgrades relating to guns more often, the further down the trees you go. You want stronger defenses? Same story. The further you invest into one "build", the more options and interesting mechanics you'll have access to. </p>
					</div>
					<div class="descend nova">
						<h2>Builds</h2>
						<p>What exactly is a build? A major part of the game is how meeting certain conditions in a single run unlocks a "super mod" for purchase. You still have to find it in the random pool, but the power they unlock (typically) defines the rest of your run. Builds in this game refer to both the weapon, ship, and shield you use, as well as the super mods you gain access to. </p>

						<h2>What's the Point?</h2>
						<p>The goal of the game is, as of this point, not implemented yet. The Final Bossâ„¢ is going to be in the final release of the game, but for the moment the goal of the game is whatever the player wants. To get as high of a score as possible, to find cool combos, or go as fast as you can, whatever it is you find fun to do. Nova Drift packs a ton of content into it's 20-30 minute runs, and having the oppurtunity to explore and experiment makes the game always feel fresh.</p>
