				<p>Welcome! This website is dedicated to the preservation and distribution of Lorn's music. While a portion of his works are available publicly through many popular streaming platforms, much of Lorn's work is either self-published or simply lesser known. The goal of this website is to collect as many sources for <i>all</i> of Lorn's music as possible, and to provide a hub for old fans and newcomers alike to find new works as they are published, or to discover old works that they haven't seen before.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>Due to how scattered much of Lorn's work is, all submissions are sorted based on their release date: Streamable, or Non-Streamable. Due to the number of different publishers and sources for Lorn's work, it made sense to try and split things based on whether they're found easily on common streaming service, or if you need to trawl through bootleg music repositories to find them.</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>(If you have found a source for a song by Lorn that is not listed on this website, please let me know through the Contact Us page! I'm always trying to vet new links, and all sources are copied locally to my server as well as through Internet Archive.)</p>
